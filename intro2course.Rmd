this is the only pie chart you will see all semester.

## Course Goals


- Gain the statistical knowledge to critically evaluate the use of statistics in the literature of bioanthro and related fields. 
- Get hands-on experience implementing analyses with real world data
- Learn practical tools for doing "data-science"

## All fields are becoming more data intensive

## "Data-science"

**Data science** is an industry buzzword and cliche

From wikipedia:


> "Data science is an interdisciplinary field about <span class="red2">**processes and systems**</span>
> to <span class="red2">**extract knowledge or insights from data**</span>.

> - In private industry, you extract insight from data to make business decisions. 
> - **It is also a big part of what scientists do!**
> - Processes and systems for getting insight from data are important!

## Data science pipeline

## Confession: I believe tools matter, a lot

<img src="https://stats.are-awesome.com/images/wrench.jpg" height='50%'>

> - We will spend a lot of time on the "how"
> - You will become very familiar with the nuts-and-bolts of analyzing data
> - Most of your grade comes from practical exercises
> - I dont expect you to be a statistician (I sure as hell am not). But I do expect you to learn **how to extract insights from data**

## Outcome of the course

When you leave this course, I hope you are empowered to:

> -  collect your data in a format that makes your future life easier
> -  explore patterns in your data visually and statistically
> -  test meaningful hypotheses using appropriate statistical tools
> -  communicate these results effectively using graphs and prose


## Tools of the Trade


> - MS Excel
> - Commercial Statistics Packages (e.g., SPSS)
> - R – open source and free package for statistical analysis

## Tools of the Trade


- MS Excel
- ~~Commercial Statistics Packages (e.g., SPSS)~~
- R – open source and free package for statistical analysis

## Why do I use R?

> - **Ignorance** - Because I don’t know how to use anything else
> - **Comprehensiveness** – Learn this one tool well, and you can do (almost) ANYTHING
> - **Reproducibility** – an R script is a detailed record of exactly what I did, from the raw data file, through data transformation, to analysis and results.
> - **Popularity** - R is insanely popular in academia and in industry ("why hello there, marketable skills!")

## What is R?


R is an **open-source** language and environment for statistical computing and graphics. 

**open-source** means that anyone can look at the code to see how it works.
